# CoVShield  - People counter in the room with measurement of their body temperature ðŸ¤’

Covshield- It is a project that is to make life easier for society in the era of COVID-19 and more. The main task of the device is to count the people in the room in which it is located, as well as to check the body temperature of the persona before its entrance. The project is innovative and ideally meets the needs of society in the times of the coronavirus pandemic. Our product is distinguished by a very low production price and a relatively small size. This is our first project and we are constantly learning, thanks to which the device will be constantly developed! ðŸ”œðŸ“ˆ

Until then, we had built our program without using git. Our latest TiP.ino program is now added. From now on, any changes to the program will be added to Github ðŸ“ŒðŸ“‚
